# Academic Research Help
This is a sample of page that could be of good use to students. Students who apply to a research internship for the first time may struggle in writing a winning proposal. As these internships are competitive, this page highlights how helpful a 'Question and Answer' page may be to a first-time applicant.

  This service is unique because it details **how** students can think of, write and finally submit a winning proposal. It also gives students a unique opportunity to hear about the experience from a successful candidate themselves, rather than just see their final work.

<h4> Writing a Winning CUROP Application </h4>

In this section, we highlight the work by [Abigail Meloche](https://carleton.ca/economics/2023/second-year-b-econ-student-abigail-meloche-announced-as-successful-candidate-of-curop-2023/) who was a recipient of the 2023 Carleton Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (CUROP) summer internship. 

CUROP gives undergraduate students the opportunity to develop their own research proposal and work under the supervision of a professor over the summer.
