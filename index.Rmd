# **The Missing Semester of Your Economics Degree**

# About us 

We are a student-led organization that seeks to promote student-centered economics research at Carleton University. 

## Mission

During the summer of 2024, a group of undergraduate and graduate students got together to brainstorm about how to make economics research more accessible to students. What they came up with was an organization that could help **connect**, **educate**, and **promote** economics research to anyone that was willing to learn. 

The need for a organization, <u> of the students </u>, <u> by the students </u>, and <u> for the students </u> of Carleton University was beginning to make more and more sense. 

Our most cherished values are at the core of our services: ensuring that  academic research, its processes, the knowledge it generates and network it builds, are freely accessible to any student who pursues it.
