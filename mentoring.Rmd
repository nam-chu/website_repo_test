The Carleton Economics Research Club facilitates the matching of students and mentors. We believe that mentors play a strong role in the development of students.

<!-- This is the first question  -->
<h4>Why did you choose to study Economics at Carleton?</h4>
<p>I was interested in learning more about Public Economics; Carleton’s Masters program in Economics is well suited for this. <br/>

Moreover, I was strongly intrigued by Carleton’s concentration in Financial Economics, as it involves courses such as: Asset Pricing, Financial Markets, Financial Econometrics, Monetary Economics, and much more. <br/>

I believe that pursuing my above interests at Carleton and adding them to my Bachelor’s in Business Economics would help me better achieve my career aspirations.
</p>

<!-- Second question  -->
<h4>What makes mentoring important to you?</h4>
<!-- Second answer  -->
<p>Mentoring is important to me because I have been fortunate enough to be a part of several successful and culturally-driven organizations that included a wide array of mentors and alumni - both from academic and athletic sectors.
<br/>

In combining my past experiences, lessons and current ambitions, my goal is to guide students as they transition towards a non-academic career and to help them build confidence.

<!-- Third question -->
<h4>What is one piece of advice you would give to your former self?</h4>

<!-- Fourth question -->
<h4>Where can students reach you?</h4>
