The Carleton Economics Research Club facilitates the matching of students and mentors. We believe that mentors play a strong role in the development of students. 

## How it works

1. Mentees fill out a survey with information about themselves. 
2. Mentors fill out a survey with information about themselves.
3. Based on their survey answers, mentees and mentors are matched.
4. The mentee and mentor communicate and agree on a meeting location. 
5. Mentors and mentees meet and discuss. 
6. A feedback survey is answered by both parties. 
7. Mentors and mentees can choose on a follow-up meeting.
