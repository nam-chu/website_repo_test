# Featured Student Researchers

This section will feature some student researchers and their experiences with the research environment. We plan on mimicking this [page](https://carleton.ca/economics/department-of-economics-student-ambassadors/)
from the department of economic's website. The idea is to students the chance to see a variety of student researchers and connect with them.

<!-- This is the first question  -->
<h4>Why did you choose to study Economics at Carleton?</h4>
<p>I chose to study Economics at Carleton for its strong emphasis on math and statistics, which provides a solid foundation for research and equips me with analytical skills applicable across various fields. This balance aligns well with my goal of becoming an academic researcher.
</p>

<!-- Second question  -->
<h4>Please give us a brief description of the research that you are doing.
</h4>
<p>I am currently researching the cost variations in CAR-T therapy manufacturing based on patient characteristics to assess its economic impact and improve accessibility. Additionally, I am analyzing patient's quality of life through utility analysis, considering baseline data at different stages of CAR-T therapy and Febrile Neutropenia in Early Stage Breast Cancer.
</p>

<!-- Third question -->
<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a student that wants to get involved with academic research? </h4>
<p> I advise consistently engaging in literature reading in your areas of interest, seeking a supervisor or mentor with aligned research interests, and building connections within the field. These steps will help deepen your understanding and ensure that academic research is the right path for you.

<!-- This is the first question  -->
<h4>Why did you choose to study Economics at Carleton?</h4>
<p>Coming from America, I wanted to choose a program in a hub of economic activity. Location was very important to me and I liked Ottawa from the moment I first visited. Factors such as proximity to the Bank of Canada and key Economic government agencies, the many concentrations offered by Carleton, and the opportunity to join the Bank of Canada Governor’s challenge drew me here.

</p>

<!-- Second question  -->
<h4>Please give us a brief description of the research that you are doing.
</h4>
<p>Currently, I am working with the dean of the department, Dr. Hashmat Khan on one of his research projects. At present, I am creating a Reduced VAR model that determines if oil prices help determine Canadian headline inflation. I cannot disclose much more, but I am learning a lot in this process and I am grateful for the opportunity. </p>

<!-- Third question -->
<h4>What piece of advice would you give to a student that wants to get involved with academic research? </h4>
<p> In my experience, I’ve found that most students who struggle with finding research opportunities skip a few steps of the process. First, it’s important to connect with your professors outside of email. Emailing a professor that you haven’t had contact with outside of class for a research opportunity won’t bring you much luck. Going to office hours, networking events, and brown bag seminars is helpful for fostering connections. Second, it’s a good idea to have specific research interests and go after professors that are experts in that field. If you are interested in comparative economics, find a professor that specializes in it, read one of their papers, and schedule a meeting with them. Remember, research is often a paid position and professors look for qualified students. </p>
