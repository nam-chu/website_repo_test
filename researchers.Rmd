# Featured Student Researchers

This section will feature some student researchers and their experiences with the research environment. We plan on mimicking this [page](https://carleton.ca/economics/department-of-economics-student-ambassadors/)
from the department of economic's website. The idea is to students the chance to see a variety of student researchers and connect with them.
